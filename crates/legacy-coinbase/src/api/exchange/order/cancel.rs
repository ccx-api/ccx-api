    /// > Cancel a previously placed order
    /// >
    /// > The order must belong to the profile that the API key belongs to. If the order

    /// This endpoint requires the "trade" permission.
    ///
    /// ## Notes
    ///
    /// Orders can be canceled using either the exchange assigned id or the client assigned
    /// client_oid. When using client_oid it must be preceded by the client: namespace.
    ///
    /// ### Response
    ///
    /// A successfully cancelled order response includes:
    ///
    /// - the order ID if the order is cancelled with the exchange assigned id,
    /// - the client assigned client_oid if the order is cancelled with client order ID.
    ///
    /// ### Cancel Reject
    ///
    /// If the order could not be canceled (already filled or previously canceled, etc.),
    /// then an error response indicates the reason in the message field.
    ///
    /// ## Parameters
    ///
    /// * `order_id` - is either the exchange assigned id or the client assigned client_oid.
    ///   When using client_oid it must be preceded by the client: namespace.
    /// * `profile_id` - Cancels orders on a specific profile
    /// * `product_id` - Optional product id of order
